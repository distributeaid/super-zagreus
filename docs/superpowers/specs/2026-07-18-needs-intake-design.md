# Needs Intake — Edit & Confirm (design)

**Status:** Approved (brainstorming)
**Date:** 2026-07-18
**Depends on:** the shipped auth + dashboard slice; [ADR-002](../../../apps/api/docs/adr/002-working-draft-endpoint.md)

## Goal

Make the dashboard's "Review & confirm needs" call-to-action functional: a partner opens
their project's needs list, reviews and edits it as a **living list** (auto-saved), and
**confirms** it — snapshotting history and resetting the 90-day freshness clock. This closes
the core loop the dashboard already advertises (PRD §5.3).

## Scope

**In scope**

- One small backend addition: a **project "working draft" endpoint** (ADR-002).
- A `/needs` page with a **View → Edit → Confirm** loop, wired to existing item endpoints.
- Search-only catalog picker; needs recorded against the catalog with the item's **locked
  default unit** (partner enters quantity only).
- Tests on both sides, following the repo [style guide](../../../docs/style-guide.md).

**Out of scope (deferred, already in PRD §8)**

- Browse-by-category catalog picker — [issue #8](https://github.com/distributeaid/super-zagreus/issues/8).
- CSV export and reporting totals (PRD §5.4).
- Missing-item request (needs a new backend entity + endpoint).
- Multiple projects per hub in the UI.

## User flow & routes

`/needs` — guarded by extending the proxy matcher to
`["/dashboard/:path*", "/needs/:path*"]`. Single page, two states:

1. **View (read-only current)** — the last confirmed needs, grouped by category, with a
   "Last confirmed …" line. A new hub (no submitted assessment) sees an empty state. A
   prominent **"Review & update needs"** button enters Edit. **The dashboard CTA links here**
   (lands in View), so visiting `/needs` never creates a draft by itself.
2. **Edit (working draft)** — "Review & update needs" calls the working-draft endpoint
   (get-or-create, seeded from current), and the list becomes editable: add, adjust quantity,
   remove — each change **auto-saves**. A **"Confirm current needs"** button submits.
3. **Confirm → View** — submit flips the draft to the new current; the page returns to
   read-only View with a "Confirmed just now" message. The dashboard's freshness badge reads
   "Up to date" on next load.

The page chooses its state on load: if an **open draft already exists** for the project,
show Edit (resume); otherwise show View. This keeps draft creation deliberate.

## Backend — working-draft endpoint

Per [ADR-002](../../../apps/api/docs/adr/002-working-draft-endpoint.md):

`POST /api/projects/{projectId}/assessments/working-draft`

- Returns the project's **open draft** (with items, including item type and unit) if one
  exists; otherwise **atomically creates** a draft seeded with a copy of the latest
  **Submitted** assessment's items (item type, quantity, unit, notes), linked via
  `SupersedesId`. Empty when there is no prior submitted assessment.
- Org-scoped like the rest of `AssessmentsController`; enforces **at most one open draft per
  project**; the get-or-create is concurrency-guarded so two racing requests cannot both
  create a draft.
- Response shape matches `GetById` (items with `ItemType` and `Unit`).

Everything else uses the **existing** endpoints unchanged: `POST/PATCH/DELETE
.../assessments/{id}/items` (auto-save), `POST .../assessments/{id}/submit` (confirm),
`GET .../assessments/current` (View), `GET /api/categories` (catalog).

**Tests (xUnit, `TestBase` + `ApiFactory` + `JwtHelper`):** creates-when-none;
seeds-items-from-current; resumes-existing-draft (no duplicate); empty-when-no-prior;
cross-org access returns 404. Seed rows satisfy FKs (Organisation → Project → Assessment).

## Frontend — data & mutation architecture

- **Reads** stay server-side via `apiGet` in server components (current needs, open-draft
  lookup, catalog).
- **Mutations** extend the server-only API client with `apiPost` / `apiPatch` / `apiDelete`
  (same Bearer attach + `401 → /login` handling as `apiGet`), called from **server actions**:
  `enterEdit` (working-draft), `addNeed`, `updateQuantity`, `removeNeed`, `confirmNeeds`.
  Client components invoke the actions and the route revalidates. The app JWT never leaves
  the server — consistent with the existing proxy pattern.
- **Auto-save** = each edit calls its action immediately, with optimistic UI and an inline
  error fallback on failure (never silently drop an edit).

## Components

- **NeedsPage** (server) — loads current + any open draft; renders View or Edit.
- **CurrentNeeds** (server) — read-only grouped summary + "Last confirmed …" / empty state +
  "Review & update needs" button.
- **NeedsEditor** (client) — the editable draft: category groups, add-need control, confirm.
- **AddNeed** (client) — **search-only typeahead** over the flattened catalog; selecting an
  item adds it with its `defaultUnit` and quantity defaulting to 1.
- **NeedRow** (client) — item name + unit, quantity input (auto-save on change), remove.
- **ConfirmButton** (client) — disabled when the list is empty (mirrors the API's ≥1-item
  rule).

A small pure **catalog helper** flattens the grouped `GET /api/categories` response into a
searchable list (`{ id, name, category, defaultUnit }`) and filters by name.

## Error handling

- Auto-save failure → keep the edit on screen, show an inline error + retry.
- `submit` with zero items → blocked in the UI and rejected by the API.
- Any `401` → existing `/login` redirect (via the extended API client).
- Catalog / draft load failure → the existing dashboard-style error boundary
  (`error.tsx` sibling for `/needs`).

## Testing

**Principle:** every unit with behavior or branching gets a unit test, and presentational
components get render tests (consistent with the existing `Button` / `ProjectCard` tests).
The only things not tested directly are the async **server component** (`NeedsPage`) and the
**server actions**, which Vitest can't exercise cleanly — so their logic is extracted into
pure functions (as with `sessionAccess` / `sessionExchange`) and those are tested.

**Backend (xUnit, `TestBase` + `ApiFactory` + `JwtHelper`):** working-draft
creates-when-none, seeds-from-current, resumes-existing, empty-when-no-prior, cross-org 404.

**Frontend (Vitest, `describe`/`it`, docstrings):**

- **Pure logic:** the catalog flatten+search helper; the **View-vs-Edit selection** function
  extracted from `NeedsPage`; and any input-shaping extracted from the server actions.
- **Extended API client:** `apiPost` / `apiPatch` / `apiDelete` — bearer header,
  `401 → /login`, and error handling — mirroring the existing `apiGet` tests.
- **Components (React Testing Library):**
  - `AddNeed` — typeahead filters the catalog by name; selecting an item adds it with the
    locked default unit and quantity 1.
  - `NeedRow` — a quantity change triggers save; the remove control fires removal.
  - `ConfirmButton` — disabled when the list is empty (mirrors the API's ≥1-item rule).
  - `CurrentNeeds` — groups by category, renders the "last confirmed" line, and the empty state.
  - `NeedsEditor` — renders rows grouped by category and wires the add / confirm controls.

This covers every component and branch; the server component and server actions are covered
through their extracted logic plus the API-client tests.
